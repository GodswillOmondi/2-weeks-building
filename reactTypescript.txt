type and interface

type X = {
	a: string,
	b: number
}
type Y = X & {
	c: number,
	d: string
}//type Y will inherit the properties of X onto the ones newly defined


using interface to inherit properties of one type to the other

interface Person {
	name: string,
	age: number
	}
interface Guy extends Person {
	proffession: string,
	bloodGroup: string
}


inheriting properties of an interface into a type

type Z = Person & {
	school: string,
	regNo: number
}

inheriting the properties of a type into an interface


type Citizen = {
	name: string,
	yob: number
	
}
interface Student extends Citizen {
	regNo: string,
	joinYear: number
	}
